## User Story
AS AN employer,
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples,
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Description
This challenge was to based on creating a personal portfolio with the same fuctioninality as the mockup. This functionality included UI scrolling, clickable images and resizing elemets realtive to different screen sizes. Below are two screenshots of how the page will load for a desktop view.

In its current state, the viewports are intended for desktop and tablet devices only (mobile version coming soon).

Please note the navigation links in the top right corner will work in tablet view if there is a sufficent amount of zoom.
